# 2.5D Fight Game on Unity

This is a role-playing martial arts fighting game.
It has classical Fighting with bots and combos!

## Credits

This game was developed on Unity Platform with my dear friends Raj Jobanputra, Sunny Sommanek and the Fqwerty.co team.

## Background

My choice of the game design was inspired from Shadow Fight by Nekki.
The goal of the project is to make a 3D and multiplayer version possible.

This was way before the Shadow Fight 3 was even released and we're glad Nekki is doing what we couldn't.
