---------------------
Note for users upgrading from ver. 1.0.2
---------------------
GUI Images have been converted to PNGs for faster import and their folder (Control-Freak-Sample-GUI-Images/) is now located inside Plugins/ folder. 
Unfortunately, old PSD files will remain after update and it may be hard to distinguish the old ones from the new ones when picking texture from 'Select Texture' dialog, since Unity strips file extensions from asset names. 
If you choose to delete the old folder (Assets/Control-Freak-Sample-GUI-Images/) be prepared to assign all your controller textures by yourself. 
Sorry for the inconvenience.
